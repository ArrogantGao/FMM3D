Flatiron Institute Fast Multipole Libraries for Laplace and Helmholtz
kernels

<p><div style="text-align:center"><imag src="docs/FMM-logo.png" width="60%"/> </div>

This codebase is a set of libraries to compute
N-body interactions for Laplace, and Helmholtz kernels, to a specified
precision, in three dimensions, on a multi-core shared-memory machine.

Please see the [online documentation](https://fmm3d.readthedocs.io),
or its equivalent [user manual](fmm3d_manual.pdf).
