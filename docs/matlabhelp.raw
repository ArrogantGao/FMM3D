   This subroutine computes the N-body Helmholtz
   interactions and its gradients in three dimensions where 
   the interaction kernel is given by e^{ikr}/r
 
   .. math::

       u(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} c_{j} e^{ik|x-x_{j}|}/|x-x_{j}| - \nabla (e^{ik|x-x_{j}|}/|x-x_{j}|) \cdot v_{j} 

   where $c_{j}$ are the charge densities
   $v_{j}$ are the dipole orientation vectors, and
   $x_{j}$ are the source locations.

   When $x=x_{m}$, the term corresponding to $x_{m}$ is dropped
   from the sum

              precision requested

   -    srcinfo.charges: complex(nd,n) 
              charge densities ($c_{j}$) (optional)
              default - term corresponding to charges dropped

               dipole orientation vectors ($v_{j}$) (optional)
               default - term corresponding to dipoles dropped 
   -    pg:  integer
              source eval flag
              potential at sources evaluated if pg = 1
              potenial and gradient at sources evaluated if pg=2

   -    targ: double(3,nt)

   -    pgt:  integer
              target eval flag

              (optional)

   Returns:

   -    U.pot  - potential at source locations if requested
   -    U.grad - gradient at source locations if requested
