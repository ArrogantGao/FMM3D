FMMLIB3D Legacy interfaces
===========================

The current version of the FMM codes are backward compatible with the
previous version of this library: `FMMLIB3D
<https::/github.com/zgimbutas/fmmlib3d>`_.
On this page, we refer to these wrappers as the legacy wrappers.

.. note::
    
    The fields associated with the potentials returned in FMMLIB3D is negative of the gradient.
